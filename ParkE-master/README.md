# ParkE
Project: ParkE (Parking Electronics) A Smart Parking System. It Involves : Ultra Sonic sensors, Arduino Uno
(Micro controller), ThingSpeak (Cloud/Iot Application) and an Android App

ParkE is a system that will help the Public find individual Parking Spots. Through our App, it will provide a map
of your current location and the vacancy status of each parking spots in your area in real-time. If you were to
happen to park in a metered parking, you can pay it through our ParkE app. ParkE uses UltraSonic sensors to
constantly sense objects within their parking spot, the vacancy status is then transferred to a micro controller
(Arduino Uno) to process the data and send it to the Cloud (ThingSpeak). Finally, our ParkE app constantly
fetches the data in the cloud for each parking spot, which then displays red for taken or green for open for each
parking spot on the map of the ParkE App. My Main Role was creating the Mobile App and supporting role in
the cloud technology. Video Demonstration : https://youtu.be/yBeQV0bRLt8
